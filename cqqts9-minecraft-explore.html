I'm looking for a somewhat casual game play style. In minecraft I find it very relaxing to just go and explore the environments. Endless tunnels and caves can be a fun thing to stroll around in. I was thinking about getting No Man's Sky but the price tag seems a bit much. Any other games I should be looking. 
Came with new Xbox not really interested in mine craft. Anyone want to hang out and build simple machines, explore and fight monsters in survival  I personally think either sky biomes either cloud cities/floating islands, or a cave update that makes the caves more interesting with maybe some sub-biomes in the caves such as bioluminescent mushrooms or spiders nests. This shit has really broken me. I can’t lie. Seeing it all unfold has been a wild ride. I’ve followed Jared for a while and now that he’s shown his true colors it’s been a rough few days. Anyways I’d figure I’d ask what’s your guys recommendations on people I should check? My go to’s have been super best friends (rip), snes drunk, game grumps, tovg stuff, moose, dunkey . I feel kinda silly because the ones I’ve named are big hitters, so I’m looking for some that I may have passed on. I’m I have learned not to underestimate children's toys or games. They always seem to teach something, or improve some skills (lego and minecraft explore creativity and spatial intelligence, for example). Although, i'm at a loss about slime-crafting and playing. What skills does it teach? How does it improve anything? So far, i was told it is for the "relaxation" or "asmr noises". Counting out the relaxation and entertainment, it seems pointless and wasteful (slimes may have a big environmental. I remember that all the channels would be sort of connected, and there was always little stories going on. Such as Sips Co and whatever Lewis and Simon were always at war; or they planned on making a Jaffa factory; or that YogLabs was a prequel to Shadow of Israphel. The last thing I remember was Rythian trying to build towards revenge on Duncan and Sjin with his dinosaur companion and Zoey, and that Sips got replaced by Zips. And Simon had gotten to the moon. What's been the story afterwards. Basically as the title suggests, looking for RPGs that give you a lot of different things to do besides just fight things, combat is fine but want other things to do beyond that such as crafting, exploring, building things, doing quests, establishing relationships, foraging, hunting animals, taming animals, fishing, mini-games, etc. etc. but not counting just the story so don't include a game purely because it's dialogue heavy, I want interactive things
