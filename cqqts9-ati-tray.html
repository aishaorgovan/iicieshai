                            <p> well i trying made textures like this post from that post https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfall/comments/6ux5ef/titanfall_2_is_truly_a_visual_spectacle_at_the/ well i jus't view the directx using the game he actually using the 11 but the tweak or ati tray tools for lod textures it's only available only directx 9 or 10 (i' don't sure) and the question is ¿it's possible made that textures for windows 10 ? i view the windows 10 use only directx 12 or somenthing like that https://imgur.com/a/PeYvydP. Well, ATi Tray tools is an amazing program, but it hasn't been updated since 2011. So I figured I'd look around for a new program to see if anything better has been made in the meantime. I ended up finding Radeon Pro. Opinions on it, provided by google, seem to mostly be from a few years ago around when Radeon Pro was a simple profile manager. Anyways, I'm downloading it now and reading the documentation, but it's getting late where I am, so I think I'm going to bed. So I figure Anyone out there know if this program will work with windows 10 64-bit? Using a new laptop with an AMD A8-6410 APU with AMD Radeon R5 Graphics (4 CPU's) ~2.0Ghz. Just looking for someone who might have knowledge on this, as the tray tools program allowed me to change every graphical setting I needed on my old windows 7 laptop. I'm interested in doing some overclocking. I've been told that ATi Tray Tools has a simple auto-overclock feature. It does indeed have a "Max GPU" and a "Max Mem" function. The problem is, I can't find any documentation or current guides on this. Considering I'm a newbie at OCing, I figured I'd ask before destroying Hi there! Does anybody know of an up-to-date piece of software that allows manually setting 2d clock speeds on the gpu? AMD's Adrenaline overclocking plummets the 2d clock speeds on my 7950 from 500/900 to 300/150, which instantly causes graphical artifacts if a second monitor is plugged in. This has been well-documented since at least 2012 and has only been fixed in a couple older versions of OverDrive/Crimson that were broken again in subsequent updates. I've also had no success in revertin. Hi guys, I just recently bought a Sapphire hd 4870 1 gb. I don't always use my pc for gaming (and even then not demanding games) so I decided to underclock it to reduce heat and fan noise. Using ati tray tools I was able to underclock to 200 mhz core / 200 mem at 775 mv (750 caused artifacting after a while). Stock voltage was 1.087 v. My question is how dangerous is this for the card? It runs at around 35-40C.

So I'm the kind of guy who likes to tweak graphics settings. A lot. I don't mind the way Tribes looks by default but in my opinion everything's a little too bloomy (even with bloom disabled in the ini), close objects can be quite jaggy and objects in the distance seem blurry. Being a big fan of the FXAA injector available for Skyrim I decided to see how it would work with Tribes. Turns out it works just fine! I reduced the bloom effect, added a color filter, sharpened distant objects and appli. My view box has an inch of black on either isde of the screen. I get a common "Catalyst Control Center could not be started, nothing to configure" error every time I try to install or reinstall or uninstall it.

This is a bunch of stuff I've picked up from r/battlefield3 and other places around the net that I put together for my clan. Hopefully it'll help some of you too. Here's a few things I've found out about getting BF3 to run without crashing (too often), resize to fit my screen when using a non-native resolution and getting the TS overlay to display without stopping either Origin or BF3 from launching. Stopping some of the crashes. Originally posted by dn00 here (http://www.reddi. 
Hi! Is there a way to set GPU fan speed below 25% in Afterburner. I am currently doing it with Ati Tray Tools in Windows 7, but Windows 8 x64 crashes when I use it. GPU is Asus Radeon My view box has an inch of black on either isde of the screen.

It happens completely randomly when I'm for example running games or using the mouse scroll wheel and I've tried everything, including reinstalling Windows and changing external hardware/ports and so on and nothing makes any difference. Sometimes it's crashing every two minute. First find you client_settings.ini file. it is located in: C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\SWTOR\swtor\settings with Owner replaced with whatever you username is. append the following to the end of the code: DebugAdvEnviroLighting = true enableadvenvirolighting = true now find do shadows and change the value from true to false if not already. while you may think shadows don't affect your gameplay, and they don't, when in a pvp situation they lag up your system incredibly and i think Hi guys! So I bought this card and installed the latest drivers from the AMD site. Talking to my more experienced friend he recommended me to use the Catalyst 14.4 or the 14.9 instead of the latest 14.12 that I'm running currently. He didn't state why. Why would that be? Another question related to the topic: Playing "Spec Ops: The Line" I was getting 35 fps average maxed out at 1080p right after installing it. The next day, (I switch off my PC at night) I played the game at the same settings. 
Just started digging for doge last night. I am very excited about getting starting and learning more. I'm using an old 5770 and on the "default" settings - just starting it up at intensity 13, I'm getting about 150khs but the fan has to be running at 100% to keep it under 80C (at 100% it stays around 74-75). I have been told that the Kalgroth fork is more efficient (but I'm getting slight less khs for the same heat, etc), but here is a thread about setting up cgminer: http://www.overclock.net. Inspired by this post ( 1. Install ATI Tray Tools ( if you aren't already using it 2. Right-click ATT icon in notification area 3. 3D gt Settings gt "Additional" Tab 4. Slide "Texture LOD Adjustment" to around -1.5 amp apply I notice no FPS difference when using this, yet it makes everything a bit more crisp. Try tweaking the setting. I have 4 Sapphire 6870 cards and I only can change the voltage of the first card using Sapphire TRIXX. I tired Ati Tray Tools amp MSI Afterburner, but they don´t work on this miner setup. Are they any cli/tools to modify the vdcc on windows for all four cards. --- Last Update: April 17th 2017 --- - STEAM Remember that 'forced perspective' tech demo that people were calling "the next Portal" last year?

Not sure if this is the right place or not. but I have a couple questions about getting the most out of my laptop. I run Catalyst Control Center and it has options for anti-aliasing settings. should I turn on AA in the game I'm playing and set CCC to use the game's settings, or turn it off in-game and set AA in CCC? I've also got ATI Tray tools running because I like the FPS meter it has and not every game has a built-in option for FPS on screen. should I use Tray Tools System: Win7 64 2x Sapphire Xtreme 5830 For the past week I've been running my 5830s at 975 core, 300 mem, at 1.063V. After reading about how the higher voltage is unsafe for 24/7 operation, I decided to downvolt back to stock .950. I've been using ATI Tray Tools for the overclocking, and I tried setting the cards back to default clocks, but ATI Tray Tools interpreted that as 157 core and 300 mem.
